# GraphForBirzeitUniversity
This project is to calculate the minimum distance for travelling between buildings in Birzeit University using a graph structure. 

The project has a map for Birzeit University, and there are a group of dots on it that represent buildings. The user can select the source and the destination from either checkBox or by clicking on the dot itself on the map. After that, an image of a person will be as an event to show the path from the source to the destination. The path is represented by lines between two consecutive buildings in the path.

The project prints the minimun cost, and shows the steps from the source to the destination in a user friendly interface.
